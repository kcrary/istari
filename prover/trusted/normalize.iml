      (* simplify M

         returns a simple form identical to M
         (Identical means modulo resolving substitutions and bound evars, and combining elims.)

         A simple form fits the grammar Ms:

         (head)
         h  ::= i
              | k
              | E[s]

         (intro) 
         Mi ::= \.M
              | <M, M>
              | next M
              | <>
              | marker

         (simple form)
         Ms ::= h spine
              | Mi
              | Mi nonempty-spine

         Note that E[s] is a head, so we expect to see E[s] @ spine.  We cannot avoid
         this by pushing evars down to base type, because:
         1. we don't have the types at this phase
         2. we don't have eta equivalence

      (* whnf M

         returns a weak-head norm form beta-equivalent to M

         A weak-head form fits the grammar Mn:

         (weak-head normal form)
         Mn ::= h spine
              | Mi

              | Mi nonempty-spine *

         * Provided Mi doesn't form a redex with the spine.
           (This case arises only for ill-typed terms and can usually be neglected.)


         Three strategies are used for normalization:
         
         Standard:
         - Reduces user redices.
         - Never unfolds soft/firm head constants.

         Hard:
         - Reduces user redices.
         - Always unfolds soft/firm head constants.

         Basic:
         - Never reduces user redices.
         - Always unfolds soft head constants.
         - Never unfolds firm head constants.
         (In other words, unfolds soft head constants but otherwise does only the 
         minimum necessary to put the term into whnf.  This is used in typechecking,
         where doing more might remove vital type annotations expressed by firm
         constants.)
