# `GirardParadox`

Girard's paradox [1] is a proof that *type* is not a type, an
adaptation of set theory's Burali-Forti paradox into type theory.

The proof works by observing that the collection of all well-founded
posets looks like a poset itself, using strict embedding as the order.
That poset of posets would need to reside one level higher in the
universe hierarchy, but if the universe hierachy is collapsed, it is a
poset at the same level.  Moreover, (if the universe hierarchy is
collapsed) we can show that the poset of posets is well-founded.
However, the poset of posets embeds into itself, which is a
contradiction.

We express the proposition that *type* is a type in Istari by saying
that `U (1 + i) <: U i`, for some level `i`.  From that it would
follow that `U i : U i`.  However, unlike the direct statement, the
statement using subtyping is
[negatable](../type-theory.html#negatability).
