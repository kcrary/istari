(* This should work with current versions of SML/NJ (version 110.89 or
   later), both 32- and 64-bit:

   (1) LargeWord is now 64 bits, even on 32-bit SML/NJ.
   (2) The Word8.toLargeInt bug is still not fixed, but we work around it.

   (With older versions of SML/NJ this can fail in a way that may be
   surprising.  The typechecker complains that wordlg does not match
   its specification, which is surprising because the specification
   and implementation are identical (type wordlg = LargeWord.word).
   However, this file is raw SML code so it uses the real SML basis,
   while the signature is IPP-processed SML, so it uses IML's version
   of the SML basis.  In the latter, LargeWord is Word64.)

   Code mostly borrowed from convert-word-nj64.sml.
