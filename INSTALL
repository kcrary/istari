Installation instructions
-------------------------

0. Ensure the prerequisites are installed:

   - Standard ML of New Jersey
   - GNU Emacs
   - (if running on Windows) Cygwin

1. Populate the cmlib directory.  This happened automatically if you
   cloned this with the --recursive option.  Otherwise enter:

   git submodule init
   git submodule update

2. Configure the build script, by copying Makefile.inc.customize to
   Makefile.inc, then edit Makefile.inc to fill in the INSTALLDIR
   definition, and to uncomment one of the MKNJEXEC definitions.

3. Build Istari:

   make smlnj

4. Install Istari:

   make install

5. Copy the contents of emacs.customize into your .emacs file, and
   edit the "istari-root" definition with the path to this directory.

6. (Optional) If you want to receive occasional updates about Istari,
   submit your name and email address using the form here:
